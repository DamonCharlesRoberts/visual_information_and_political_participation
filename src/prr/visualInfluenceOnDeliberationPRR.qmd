  Though political deliberation benefits those often excluded from politics, some argue that many individuals avoid such situations in an age of hyper-partisanship and affective polarization. Existing literature on this topic argue that individuals often seek to avoid uncomfortable situations that are caused by disagreement about politics. The outcomes of such motivations are often thought to increase affective polarization and to have negative participatory impacts for those who are often excluded or feel unwelcome in politics. Much of this work assumes that people know the partisanship of potential discussion partners and avoid those who are known to be out-partisans. For those that are strangers, some evidence suggests that we often can rely on cultural stereotypes of the other party to help us assume the partisanship of this potential discussion partner. This project argues that even more simple visual information can and is used by individuals to decide whether or not to engage in a discussion with another and can shape the outcomes of a conversation. It lays out a cognitive mechanism explaining how individuals make decisions to engage in a conversation and the limits by which deliberation may buffer political polarization.

# Introduction

Do politically-relevant colors predict our propensity to engage in political conversations? Does this have downstream consequences for formal political participation and for affective polarization? Conversations about politics is often considered to be a central component of political behavior in American democracy [@huckfeldt_2007_ohpb]. Evidence suggests that political conversations encourage many different forms of participation in politics [@verba_et-al_1995_hup;@klofstad_2007_prq], increase one's levels of political knowledge [@mcclurg_2003_prq] and is even capable of buffering animosity toward out-partisans [@levendusky_stecula_2021_cup]. Though it has these benefits, the existing literature in political science demonstrates that social groups, and particularly partisanship, motivate vast amounts of political behavior as well. One primary way that this manifests is the degree to which we interact with out-partisans relative to co-partisans. Rooted in classic social identity theory, the argument is that we have these tendencies out of a motivation to defend our pre-existing beliefs [@kunda_1990_pb;@jost_et-al_2022_n]. 

Evidence of motivated reasoning  manifests in a number of political [see @iyengar_westwood_2015_ajps] and even non-political [@nicholson_et-al_2016_pb] contexts. First, many of our networks for whom we talk to regularly are constructed of close friends and family and we are often reluctant to harm those relationships through disagreement [@mutz_2002_apsr;@mutz_2006_cup]. Second, even outside of our family and close friends, our networks are quite politically homogenous [@huckfeldt_sprague_1987;@butters_hare_2022_pb]. Third, evidence suggests that even if we are offered information from other political perspectives, we do not try to integrate it with our prior beliefs [@kunda_1990_pb;@lodge_taber_2013_cup] and the benefits of any exposure to such information do not last very long [@levendusky_stecula_2021_cup] as a result.

Though the literature is mixed on whether cross-partisan conversations are beneficial for formal participation and reducing affective polarization, much of the evidence for their drawbacks start from the position that we enter a conversation with motivated reasoning already active. While this offers leverage to researchers to determine whether we can overcome motivated reasoning, it muddies our ability to make claims about deliberation's effects on affective polarization and participation. In response, some have put in effort to examine the ways in which individuals enter political conversations without prior information about another's political viewpoints. @carlson_settle_2022_cup argue that we can use the clothing of others to make an informed guess about the partisanship of a potential discussion partner. For example, it would probably be reasonable to assume that someone wearing a Patagonia jacket would be a Democrat and someone wearing a Carhartt jacket would be Republican. Just these assumptions based on the appearance of another person can lead someone to avoid a potential political conversation with others [@carlson_settle_2022_cup]. This fits with a well-established literature in political psychology that suggests that there are cultural differences between partisans [@hetherington_weiler_2018_hmh] and a rich literature in social psychology demonstrating the role of social groups, more broadly, have visual cues that we cultivate for ourselves and detect in others [see @pietraszewski_et-al_2015_c].

I argue that the visual information required to encourage such behavior need not necessarily be as complex as things like the branding of someone's clothes. Colors convey significant amounts of information by themselves. Visual information such as color is among the fastest types of information that humans process [see @ames_et-al_2012_ohsn]. Colors in particular are deeply embedded into a number of schemas that organize our previous experiences which enable the processing and reacting to new information [see @cimbalo_et-al_1978_jgp]. Colors not only have strong associations with our affective state [see @mehta_zhu_2009_s;@elliot_maier_2012_aesp], but they also convey significant amounts of information about social groups [@pietraszewski_et-al_2015_c].

As colors provide potent information about salient social groups, I argue that politically-relevant colors, red and blue, are important informational cues that individuals rely upon to evaluate others and their ideological positions when politics is salient to them. The implication of this argument is that when individuals make such connections, we can predict behavioral motivations and outcomes depending on one's valanced associations with those colors in a political context. The motivations to engage or avoid in political conversations generated from such simple visual information can have serious implications for political participation and polarization.

In the following sections I elaborate on the cognitive processes that lend themselves to such a mechanism. After detailing the existing literature on this, I outline a snap-judgment model of political information processing that demonstrates the implications for propensity to engage in a political conversation and to reduce political polarization. Following that, I explore empirical evidence of this theory by performing an experiment.
